# Webhook-Messenger
I have made a simple application (.exe) that allows you to send any message to a discord webhook kinda like discohook but not so advanced 
 As soon as you run the application you'll be promted with something that asks for the webhook link just copy and paste it in then it'll ask for the message you want to send then you just type it and press enter
 
# IF the application doesn't work
If it doesn't work you must have python installed make sure you do and have the latest version make sure you also have the pip module installed because if it still don't work do pip install requests
