# Webhook-Messenger
I have made a simple application (.exe) that allows you to send any message to a discord webhook kinda like discohook but not so advanced 
 As soon as you run the application you'll be promted with something that asks for the webhook link just copy and paste it in then it'll ask for the message you want to send then you just type it and press enter
